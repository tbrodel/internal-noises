# internal-noises

*internal noises* is an instructional sound work focussing on the performativity
of listening. The author, urging audiences to listen variously to real, imagined,
hypothetical or impossible sound events, interrogates the role of listener in the
production of sound.

When we hear sounds we transduce air-pressure fluctuations into meaningful
sensory input - we take actual materials and make them mental. *internal noises*
emphasises the psychic sound-making process. It virtualises sound's
production, akin to a musical score; conducted in language, performed in
thought. In this work we confront the transitory nature of perception,
travelling between poles of actual and virtual.

*internal noises* seeks to trouble the roles of composer, performer and listener,
breaking down their identities. The ear is displaced as listening organ in
favour of a body, assembled from flesh, text and thought, shared between
listeners/performers/composers.

William Burroughs wrote of the word as virus; a mental illness, a parasite,
controlling minds through inevitable sound. This work proposes the written
word as a sonic material and a means of control. The sound of this
acoustically silent work is only available by entering into the masochistic
contract of wordnoise.
